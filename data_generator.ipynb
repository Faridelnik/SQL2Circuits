    "1. You need to have PostgreSQL database installed and configured\n",

    "3. Create an empty database (imdb2017) for the user (postgres) with the following code:\n",

    "IMDB is providing newer but less comprehensive [dataset](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/). Cinemagoer describes how to upload that data into Postgres but because the join order benchmark queries are built on the older dataset, we also need to use the older one."
