    "This notebook implements the part of the algorithm which translates join order benchmark (JOB) and the simplified join order benchmark queries into pregroup diagrams and pregroup diagrams into circuit ansätze. The simple example can be found in `sql_to_circuit_simple_example` notebook.\n",

    "The following code generates diagrams for all the SELECT-FROM-WHERE queries in the join order benchmark and their simplified versions. Running the code will take some time and it also works as a test package for the code. The diagrams are already generated in the folders `join-order-benchmark-diagrams` and `simplified-JOB-diagrams`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunalyte, JOB queries produce too large circuits for quantum computing resources that we have available. That is why we created the set of simplified queries. As in the data generation case, this notebook is for reproducibility reasons and the user does not need to rerun this if they do not want to change the underlying queries or the mappings."
